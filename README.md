# Garden Sim

Garden Sim is a small-scale, gamified garden simulation created in Unity that deals with autonomous agents interacting within a game space. In this top-down perspective game, players will help place flowers to be pollinated by bees and butterflies. Players must  interact with the different critters of the ecosystem to plant flowers in ideal spots where critters flock, while simultaneously avoiding the beetlesâ€“an invasive species which will drive critters away and damage the ecosystem.
